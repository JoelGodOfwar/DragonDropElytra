DaragonDropElytra

Plan to add:
  Folia Support.
    During testing on a Folia server DDE did not detect the Dragon's death and did not drop the elytra, or any other items.

Feature request:
- If the killer of the enderdragon has never defeated the dragon before (eg. does not have the "free the end" advancement), then drop the egg.
